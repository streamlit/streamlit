name: "Set PREVIEW_BRANCH & BRANCH env variables"

# Using an action to process user input (branch name) as an argument
# is the recommended approach for mitigating script injection attacks.
# It is not vulnerable to injection attacks, as the context value is not used
# to generate a shell script, but is instead passed to the action as an argument
