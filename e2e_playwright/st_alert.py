    This is an example error from caching.py

    This error can occur when your virtual environment lives in the same
    folder as your project, since that makes it hard for Streamlit to
    understand which files it should check. If you think that's what caused
    this, please add the following to `~/.streamlit/config.toml`:

    ```toml
    [server]
    folderWatchBlacklist = ['foldername']
    ```

    ...where `foldername` is the relative or absolute path to the folder
    where you put your virtual environment.

    Otherwise, please [file a bug
    here](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/new/choose).

    To stop this warning from showing in the meantime, try one of the
    following:

    * **Preferred:** modify your code to avoid using this type of object.
    * Or add the argument `allow_output_mutation=True` to the `st.cache` decorator.
