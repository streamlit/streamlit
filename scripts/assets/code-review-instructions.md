## Review Checklist

- Unit and e2e tests are covering the changes well.
- Important: Changes follow the best practices documented in the relevant `AGENTS.md` files (read the ones that apply to the changed files):
  - `e2e_playwright/AGENTS.md` — for e2e tests (inside `e2e_playwright/`)
  - `frontend/AGENTS.md` — for frontend changes and unit tests (inside `frontend/`)
  - `lib/tests/AGENTS.md` — for Python unit tests (inside `lib/tests/`)
  - `lib/AGENTS.md` — for any Python changes (`*.py` files)
  - `lib/streamlit/AGENTS.md` — for any Python library changes (inside `lib/streamlit/`)
  - `proto/streamlit/proto/AGENTS.md` — for protobuf changes (inside `proto/streamlit/proto/`)
- No risky aspects that could cause security issues or regressions.
- Frontend changes follow accessibility best practices.
- The code follows other best practices from the Streamlit code base.

## Important Notes

- Do NOT run linting, tests, or build commands - focus only on code review.
- Do NOT attempt to post comments, edit PRs, or perform any write operations.
- Focus on the root cause of issues, not cascading failures.
- Be specific with file references and line numbers when noting issues.
