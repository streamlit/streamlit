    """Execute the passed function wrapped in a try/except block.

    This function is called by the script runner to execute the user's script or
    fragment reruns, but also for the execution of fragment code in context of a normal
    app run. This wrapper ensures that handle_uncaught_exception messages show up in the
    correct context.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        The function to execute wrapped in the try/except block.
    ctx : ScriptRunContext
        The context in which the script is being run.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing:
        - The result of the passed function.
        - A boolean indicating whether the script ran without errors (RerunException and
            StopException don't count as errors).
        - The RerunData instance belonging to a RerunException if the script was
            interrupted by a RerunException.
        - A boolean indicating whether the script was stopped prematurely (False for
            RerunExceptions, True for all other exceptions).
