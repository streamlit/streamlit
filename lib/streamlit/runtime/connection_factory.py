    Configuration options, credentials, and secrets for connections are
    combined from the following sources:

    - The keyword arguments passed to this command.
    - The app's ``secrets.toml`` files.
    - Any connection-specific configuration files.

    The connection returned from ``st.connection`` is internally cached with
    ``st.cache_resource`` and is therefore shared between sessions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The connection name used for secrets lookup in ``secrets.toml``.
        Streamlit uses secrets under ``[connections.<name>]`` for the
        connection. ``type`` will be inferred if ``name`` is one of the
        following: ``"snowflake"``, ``"snowpark"``, or ``"sql"``.

    type : str, connection class, or None
        The type of connection to create. This can be one of the following:

        - ``None`` (default): Streamlit will infer the connection type from
          ``name``. If the type is not inferrable from ``name``, the type must
          be specified in ``secrets.toml`` instead.
        - ``"snowflake"``: Streamlit will initialize a connection with
          |SnowflakeConnection|_.
        - ``"snowpark"``: Streamlit will initialize a connection with
          |SnowparkConnection|_. This is deprecated.
        - ``"sql"``: Streamlit will initialize a connection with
          |SQLConnection|_.
        - A string path to an importable class: This must be a dot-separated
          module path ending in the importable class. Streamlit will import the
          class and initialize a connection with it. The class must extend
          ``st.connections.BaseConnection``.
        - An imported class reference: Streamlit will initialize a connection
          with the referenced class, which must extend
          ``st.connections.BaseConnection``.

        .. |SnowflakeConnection| replace:: ``SnowflakeConnection``
        .. _SnowflakeConnection: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/connections/st.connections.snowflakeconnection
        .. |SnowparkConnection| replace:: ``SnowparkConnection``
        .. _SnowparkConnection: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/connections/st.connections.snowparkconnection
        .. |SQLConnection| replace:: ``SQLConnection``
        .. _SQLConnection: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/connections/st.connections.sqlconnection

    max_entries : int or None
        The maximum number of connections to keep in the cache.
        If this is ``None`` (default), the cache is unbounded. Otherwise, when
        a new entry is added to a full cache, the oldest cached entry is
        removed.
    ttl : float, timedelta, or None
        The maximum number of seconds to keep results in the cache.
        If this is ``None`` (default), cached results do not expire with time.
    **kwargs : any
        Connection-specific keyword arguments that are passed to the
        connection's ``._connect()`` method. ``**kwargs`` are typically
        combined with (and take precendence over) key-value pairs in
        ``secrets.toml``. To learn more, see the specific connection's
        documentation.

    Returns
    -------
    Subclass of BaseConnection
        An initialized connection object of the specified ``type``.

    Examples
    --------

    **Example 1**

    The easiest way to create a first-party (SQL, Snowflake, or Snowpark) connection is
    to use their default names and define corresponding sections in your ``secrets.toml``
    file. The following example creates a ``"sql"``-type connection.

    ``.streamlit/secrets.toml``:

    >>> [connections.sql]
    >>> dialect = "xxx"
    >>> host = "xxx"
    >>> username = "xxx"
    >>> password = "xxx"

    Your app code:

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>> conn = st.connection("sql")

    **Example 2**

    Creating a connection with a custom name requires you to explicitly
    specify the type. If ``type`` is not passed as a keyword argument, it must
    be set in the appropriate section of ``secrets.toml``. The following
    example creates two ``"sql"``-type connections, each with their own
    custom name. The first defines ``type`` in the ``st.connection`` command;
    the second defines ``type`` in ``secrets.toml``.

    ``.streamlit/secrets.toml``:

    >>> [connections.first_connection]
    >>> dialect = "xxx"
    >>> host = "xxx"
    >>> username = "xxx"
    >>> password = "xxx"
    >>>
    >>> [connections.second_connection]
    >>> type = "sql"
    >>> dialect = "yyy"
    >>> host = "yyy"
    >>> username = "yyy"
    >>> password = "yyy"

    Your app code:

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>> conn1 = st.connection("first_connection", type="sql")
    >>> conn2 = st.connection("second_connection")

    **Example 3**

    Passing the full module path to the connection class can be useful,
    especially when working with a custom connection. Although this is not the
    typical way to create first party connections, the following example
    creates the same type of connection as one with ``type="sql"``. Note that
    ``type`` is a string path.

    ``.streamlit/secrets.toml``:

    >>> [connections.my_sql_connection]
    >>> url = "xxx+xxx://xxx:xxx@xxx:xxx/xxx"

    Your app code:

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>> conn = st.connection(
    ...     "my_sql_connection", type="streamlit.connections.SQLConnection"
    ... )

    **Example 4**

    You can pass the connection class directly to the ``st.connection``
    command. Doing so allows static type checking tools such as ``mypy`` to
    infer the exact return type of ``st.connection``. The following example
    creates the same connection as in Example 3.

    ``.streamlit/secrets.toml``:

    >>> [connections.my_sql_connection]
    >>> url = "xxx+xxx://xxx:xxx@xxx:xxx/xxx"

    Your app code:

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>> from streamlit.connections import SQLConnection
    >>> conn = st.connection("my_sql_connection", type=SQLConnection)
