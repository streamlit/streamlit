        It's an error to pass a URL to this function. (Media stored at
        external URLs can be served directly to the Streamlit frontend;
        there's no need to store this data in MediaFileStorage.)

        Parameters
        ----------
        path_or_data
            A path to a file, or the file's raw data as bytes.

        mimetype
            The media's mimetype. Used to set the Content-Type header when
            serving the media over HTTP.

        kind
            The kind of file this is: either MEDIA, or DOWNLOADABLE.

        filename : str or None
            Optional filename. Used to set the filename in the response header.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            The unique ID of the media file.

        Raises
        ------
        MediaFileStorageError
            Raised if the media can't be loaded (for example, if a file
            path is invalid).

            The file's ID, returned from load_media_and_get_id().

        Returns
        -------
        str
            A URL that the frontend can load the file from. Because this
            URL may expire, it should not be cached!

        This should be called when a given file is no longer referenced
        by any connected client, so that the MediaFileStorage can free its
        resources.

        Calling `delete_file` on a file_id that doesn't exist is allowed,
        and is a no-op. (This means that multiple `delete_file` calls with
        the same file_id is not an error.)

        Note: implementations can choose to ignore `delete_file` calls -
        this function is a *suggestion*, not a *command*. Callers should
        not rely on file deletion happening immediately (or at all).

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_id
            The file's ID, returned from load_media_and_get_id().

        Returns
        -------
        None

        Raises
        ------
        MediaFileStorageError
            Raised if file deletion fails for any reason. Note that these
            failures will generally not be shown on the frontend (file
            deletion usually occurs on session disconnect).
