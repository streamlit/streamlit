"""Declares the CacheStorageContext dataclass, which contains parameter information for
each function decorated by `@st.cache_data` (for example: ttl, max_entries etc.)

Declares the CacheStorageManager protocol, which implementations are used
to create CacheStorage instances and to optionally clear all cache storages,
that were created by this manager, and to check if the context is valid for the storage.

Declares the CacheStorage protocol, which implementations are used to store cached
values for a single `@st.cache_data` decorated function serialized as bytes.

How these classes work together
-------------------------------
- CacheStorageContext : this is a dataclass that contains the parameters from
`@st.cache_data` that are passed to the CacheStorageManager.create() method.

- CacheStorageManager : each instance of this is able to create CacheStorage
instances, and optionally to clear data of all cache storages.

- CacheStorage : each instance of this is able to get, set, delete, and clear
entries for a single `@st.cache_data` decorated function.
