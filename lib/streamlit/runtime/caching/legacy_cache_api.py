    """Legacy caching decorator (deprecated).

    Legacy caching with ``st.cache`` has been removed from Streamlit. This is
    now an alias for ``st.cache_data`` and ``st.cache_resource``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        The function to cache. Streamlit hashes the function's source code.

    persist : bool
        Whether to persist the cache on disk.

    allow_output_mutation : bool
        Whether to use ``st.cache_data`` or ``st.cache_resource``. If this is
        ``False`` (default), the arguments are passed to ``st.cache_data``. If
        this is ``True``, the arguments are passed to ``st.cache_resource``.

    show_spinner : bool
        Enable the spinner. Default is ``True`` to show a spinner when there is
        a "cache miss" and the cached data is being created.

    suppress_st_warning : bool
        This is not used.

    hash_funcs : dict or None
        Mapping of types or fully qualified names to hash functions. This is used to override
        the behavior of the hasher inside Streamlit's caching mechanism: when the hasher
        encounters an object, it will first check to see if its type matches a key in this
        dict and, if so, will use the provided function to generate a hash for it. See below
        for an example of how this can be used.

    max_entries : int or None
        The maximum number of entries to keep in the cache, or ``None``
        for an unbounded cache. (When a new entry is added to a full cache,
        the oldest cached entry will be removed.) The default is ``None``.

    ttl : float or None
        The maximum number of seconds to keep an entry in the cache, or
        None if cache entries should not expire. The default is None.

    Example
    -------
    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>>
    >>> @st.cache
    ... def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    ...     # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    ...     return data
    ...
    >>> d1 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_1)
    >>> # Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
    >>> # encountered.
    >>>
    >>> d2 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_1)
    >>> # Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
    >>> # value. This means that now the data in d1 is the same as in d2.
    >>>
    >>> d3 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_2)
    >>> # This is a different URL, so the function executes.

    To set the ``persist`` parameter, use this command as follows:

    >>> @st.cache(persist=True)
    ... def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    ...     # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    ...     return data

    To disable hashing return values, set the ``allow_output_mutation`` parameter to ``True``:

    >>> @st.cache(allow_output_mutation=True)
    ... def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    ...     # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    ...     return data


    To override the default hashing behavior, pass a custom hash function.
    You can do that by mapping a type (e.g. ``MongoClient``) to a hash function (``id``) like this:

    >>> @st.cache(hash_funcs={MongoClient: id})
    ... def connect_to_database(url):
    ...     return MongoClient(url)

    Alternatively, you can map the type's fully-qualified name
    (e.g. ``"pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient"``) to the hash function instead:

    >>> @st.cache(hash_funcs={"pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient": id})
    ... def connect_to_database(url):
    ...     return MongoClient(url)

`st.cache` is deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use one of Streamlit's new caching commands, `st.cache_data` or `st.cache_resource`.
More information [in our docs]({CACHE_DOCS_URL}).

**Note**: The behavior of `st.cache` was updated in Streamlit 1.36 to the new caching logic used by `st.cache_data` and `st.cache_resource`.
This might lead to some problems or unexpected behavior in certain edge cases.
