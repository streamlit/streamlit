        #     seems odd (even if we normally do this before running a fragment not
        #     triggered by st.rerun()) because it defers the execution of st.rerun().
        #   * Rerunning the full app feels incorrect as we're seemingly ignoring the

    When ``st.rerun()`` is called, Streamlit halts the current script run and
    executes no further statements. Streamlit immediately queues the script to
    rerun.

    When using ``st.rerun`` in a fragment, you can scope the rerun to the
    fragment. However, if a fragment is running as part of a full-app rerun,
    a fragment-scoped rerun is not allowed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scope : "app" or "fragment"
        Specifies what part of the app should rerun. If ``scope`` is ``"app"``
        (default), the full app reruns. If ``scope`` is ``"fragment"``,
        Streamlit only reruns the fragment from which this command is called.

        Setting ``scope="fragment"`` is only valid inside a fragment during a
        fragment rerun. If ``st.rerun(scope="fragment")`` is called during a
        full-app rerun or outside of a fragment, Streamlit will raise a
