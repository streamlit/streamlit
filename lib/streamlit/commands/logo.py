    Renders a logo in the upper-left corner of your app and its sidebar.

    If ``st.logo`` is called multiple times within a page, Streamlit will
    render the image passed in the last call. For the most consistent results,
    call ``st.logo`` early in your page script and choose an image that works
    well in both light and dark mode. Avoid empty margins around your image.

    If your logo does not work well for both light and dark mode, consider
    setting the theme and hiding the settings menu from users with the
    `configuration option <https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml>`_
    ``client.toolbarMode="minimal"``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image: Anything supported by st.image
        The image to display in the upper-left corner of your app and its
        sidebar. If ``icon_image`` is also provided, then Streamlit will only
        display ``image`` in the sidebar.

        Streamlit scales the image to a max height set by ``size`` and a max
        width to fit within the sidebar.
    size: "small", "medium", or "large"
        The size of the image displayed in the upper-left corner of the app and its
        sidebar. The possible values are as follows:

        - ``"small"``: 20px max height
        - ``"medium"`` (default): 24px max height
        - ``"large"``: 32px max height

    link : str or None
        The external URL to open when a user clicks on the logo. The URL must
        start with "\\http://" or "\\https://". If ``link`` is ``None`` (default),
        the logo will not include a hyperlink.
    icon_image: Anything supported by st.image or None
        An optional, typically smaller image to replace ``image`` in the
        upper-left corner when the sidebar is closed. If ``icon_image`` is
        ``None`` (default), Streamlit will always display ``image`` in the
        upper-left corner, regardless of whether the sidebar is open or closed.
        Otherwise, Streamlit will render ``icon_image`` in the upper-left
        corner of the app when the sidebar is closed.

        Streamlit scales the image to a max height set by ``size`` and a max
        width to fit within the sidebar. If the sidebar is closed, the max
        width is retained from when it was last open.

        For best results, pass a wide or horizontal image to ``image`` and a
        square image to ``icon_image``. Or, pass a square image to ``image``
        and leave ``icon_image=None``.

    Examples
    --------
    A common design practice is to use a wider logo in the sidebar, and a
    smaller, icon-styled logo in your app's main body.

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>>
    >>> st.logo(
    ...     LOGO_URL_LARGE,
    ...     link="https://streamlit.io/gallery",
    ...     icon_image=LOGO_URL_SMALL,
    ... )

    Try switching logos around in the following example:

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>>
    >>> HORIZONTAL_RED = "images/horizontal_red.png"
    >>> ICON_RED = "images/icon_red.png"
    >>> HORIZONTAL_BLUE = "images/horizontal_blue.png"
    >>> ICON_BLUE = "images/icon_blue.png"
    >>>
    >>> options = [HORIZONTAL_RED, ICON_RED, HORIZONTAL_BLUE, ICON_BLUE]
    >>> sidebar_logo = st.selectbox("Sidebar logo", options, 0)
    >>> main_body_logo = st.selectbox("Main body logo", options, 1)
    >>>
    >>> st.logo(sidebar_logo, icon_image=main_body_logo)
    >>> st.sidebar.markdown("Hi!")

        height: 300px
