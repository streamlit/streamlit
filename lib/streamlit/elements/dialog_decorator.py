    Note that the check like this only works when Dialog is called as a context manager,
    as this populates the dg_stack in delta_generator correctly.

    This does not detect the edge case in which someone calls, for example,
    `with st.sidebar` inside of a dialog function and opens a dialog in there, as
    `with st.sidebar` pushes the new DeltaGenerator to the stack. In order to check for
    that edge case, we could try to check all DeltaGenerators in the stack, and not only
    the last one. Since we deem this to be an edge case, we lean towards simplicity
    here.

    """Function decorator to create a modal dialog.

    A function decorated with ``@st.dialog`` becomes a dialog
    function. When you call a dialog function, Streamlit inserts a modal dialog
    into your app. Streamlit element commands called within the dialog function
    render inside the modal dialog.

    The dialog function can accept arguments that can be passed when it is
    called. Any values from the dialog that need to be accessed from the wider
    app should generally be stored in Session State.

    A user can dismiss a modal dialog by clicking outside of it, clicking the
    "**X**" in its upper-right corner, or pressing ``ESC`` on their keyboard.
    Dismissing a modal dialog does not trigger an app rerun. To close the modal
    dialog programmatically, call ``st.rerun()`` explicitly inside of the
    dialog function.

    To enforce that dialogs are always closed programmatically, you can set the
    ``dismissible`` parameter to ``False``. This will hide the "**X**" button in the
    upper-right corner of the dialog and prevent the user from dismissing the dialog
    by clicking outside of it or pressing ``ESC``.

    ``st.dialog`` inherits behavior from |st.fragment|_.
    When a user interacts with an input widget created inside a dialog function,
    Streamlit only reruns the dialog function instead of the full script.

    Calling ``st.sidebar`` in a dialog function is not supported.

    Dialog code can interact with Session State, imported modules, and other
    Streamlit elements created outside the dialog. Note that these interactions
    are additive across multiple dialog reruns. You are responsible for
    handling any side effects of that behavior.

    .. warning::
        Only one dialog function may be called in a script run, which means
        that only one dialog can be open at any given time.

    .. |st.fragment| replace:: ``st.fragment``
    .. _st.fragment: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/execution-flow/st.fragment

    Parameters
    ----------
    title : str
        The title to display at the top of the modal dialog. It cannot be empty.
    width : "small", "large"
        The width of the modal dialog. If ``width`` is ``"small`` (default), the
        modal dialog will be 500 pixels wide. If ``width`` is ``"large"``, the
        modal dialog will be about 750 pixels wide.
    dismissible : bool
        Whether the modal dialog can be dismissed by clicking outside of it or by pressing ``ESC``.
        Setting it to False also hides the ``X`` button in the upper-right corner of the dialog.

    Examples
    --------
    The following example demonstrates the basic usage of ``@st.dialog``.
    In this app, clicking "**A**" or "**B**" will open a modal dialog and prompt you
    to enter a reason for your vote. In the modal dialog, click "**Submit**" to record
    your vote into Session State and rerun the app. This will close the modal dialog
    since the dialog function is not called during the full-script rerun.

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>>
    >>> @st.dialog("Cast your vote")
    >>> def vote(item):
    >>>     st.write(f"Why is {item} your favorite?")
    >>>     reason = st.text_input("Because...")
    >>>     if st.button("Submit"):
    >>>         st.session_state.vote = {"item": item, "reason": reason}
    >>>         st.rerun()
    >>>
    >>> if "vote" not in st.session_state:
    >>>     st.write("Vote for your favorite")
    >>>     if st.button("A"):
    >>>         vote("A")
    >>>     if st.button("B"):
    >>>         vote("B")
    >>> else:
    >>>     f"You voted for {st.session_state.vote['item']} because {st.session_state.vote['reason']}"
