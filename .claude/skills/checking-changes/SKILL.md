# Checking Changes

**Run at the end of a work session** or after completing a set of changes — not after every small edit.

```bash
make check
```

This runs formatting, linting, type checking, and unit tests on all uncommitted files (staged, unstaged, and untracked).

## Workflow

1. Run `make check`
2. If issues are found:
   - Fix the reported errors
   - Re-run `make check`
   - Repeat until all checks pass
3. Only consider work complete when `make check` succeeds

## Notes

- E2E tests are not included by default; use `E2E_CHECK=true make check` to also run changed e2e tests
- E2E snapshot mismatches can be ignored (they require manual updates)
