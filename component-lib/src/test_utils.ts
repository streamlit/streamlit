// A function that doesn't do anything, but allows you to release
// handlers so that pending events can be executed.
//
// MDN explains this as well:
//
// postMessage() schedules the MessageEvent to be dispatched only after all pending execution
// contexts have finished. For example, if postMessage() is invoked in an event handler,
// that event handler will run to completion, as will any remaining handlers for that same
// event, before the MessageEvent is dispatched.
